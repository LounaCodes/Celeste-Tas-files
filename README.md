<h1>My TAS project collection</h1>

__[NOTE]
I am currently contributing to a larger project, for trying to beat the game with as least dashes as possible with the "Every jump is an Ultra" Variant enabled. I will probably still upload some of my files, especially WIP ones to this repo, but for the full project at its current state check out the repo [here](https://github.com/CelerityTAS/UltraJumpMindashTAS).__

<body>This is where I collect, share and maintain all of my TAS projects. There is not much to say, but if you want to contribute in improving and/or fixing something, feel free to make a pull request.</body>
<body>If you have any questions or want to chat, just hit me up on Discord: <code>_0_yee_0_</code></body>
